# config-king

A declarative manager for linux systems, mainly for arch-based systems. Its main focus is to let you manage installed packages easily, and have a centralised source of config files, which can then be symbollicaly linked where needed, amongst other things.

The config files are written in lua, for easy usage and customisation.
